Description: Sample ancestral trees conditional on phased or unphased SNP genotype data. The actual tree sampling is done using a C++ program that is launched within R. The package also contains functions for specifying the tree-sampling settings (pre-processing) and for storing and manipulating the sampled trees (post-processing). More information about 'sampletrees' can be found at <http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html>.
