Title: Sampletrees Input/Output Processing
Description: Contains functions that are useful for pre- and post-processing the tree output from the MCMC-based C++ program sampletrees. The program sampletrees is used to sample gene genealogies conditional on either phased or unphased SNP genotype data. More information about sampletrees can be found at http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html . Pre-processing tasks involve creating the settings file, the haplotype estimation files (if input data is genotype), and error checking the settings. Post-processing involves reading in the MCMC output from a run of sampletrees and computing summary statistics.
