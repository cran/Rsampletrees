Description: Sample ancestral trees conditional on phased or unphased SNP genotype data. The actual tree sampling is done using a C++ program that is launched within R. The package also contains functions for specifying the tree-sampling settings (pre-processing) and for storing and manipulating the sampled trees (post-processing).
